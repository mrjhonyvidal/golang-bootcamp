Structure: 

- Basics
    - Arrays
        - Primitive data structure
        - Cant't be resized
        - Rarely used directly
    Slices 
        - Can grow and shrink
        - Used 99% of the time for lists of elements

- Structs
    - Structs and points
- Maps
- Interfaces
- Channels and Go Routines

Value Types (Use pointers to change these things in a function) | Reference Types (Don't worry about pointers)
------------ | -------------
int | slices 
float | maps
string | channels
bool | pointers
structs | functions
